# Predictive Modelling with analogs

F. Sevellec presented us with the method used in [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-05442-8](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-05442-8)

[The talk/slides is available under pres.pdf](pres.pdf)

The Matlab script [trans_op.m](trans_op.m) runs the methodology using files under the ``Data`` folder.

You can play with:

-  the size of the catalogue using the ``vmodel`` list,
-  the method based on an Markov Chain or Analog with ``fmarkchain``,
-  and the year to start predictions from with ``year``.
